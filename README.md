# 🧪 Dev Lab

Dev Lab is a technical laboratory repository that contains a curated collection of software development projects, technical challenges, algorithms, and experiments related to backend, frontend, and full-stack engineering.

The purpose of this repository is not only to showcase finished applications, but also to demonstrate problem-solving skills, technical reasoning, architectural decisions, and experimentation with different technologies and approaches.

This repository serves as a technical portfolio and a living workspace where concepts are explored, validated, and refined through practical implementation.

## 🎯 Objectives

Demonstrate software engineering skills through real code and technical challenges

Showcase problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

Explore design decisions, trade-offs, and best practices

Maintain a clear, organized, and well-documented codebase

Provide a transparent view of how problems are approached, not only their final result

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by domain and purpose, not by technology alone.

## 📄 Project Documentation

Each project or exercise inside this repository aims to include a README that answers:

What problem does this solve?

Why was this approach chosen?

What technical decisions were made?

What does this project demonstrate?

The focus is on clarity and reasoning, not only on code quantity.

## 🛠️ Technologies

This repository may include projects developed using different technologies and tools, depending on the purpose of each exercise, such as:

Backend frameworks and APIs

Frontend frameworks and UI libraries

Databases and data processing tools

Scripting and automation

Algorithmic and computational approaches

The specific stack is documented at the project level.

## 🚫 What This Repository Is Not

❌ A tutorial dump

❌ A collection of unfinished or unexplained code

❌ A single-technology showcase

❌ A production-ready monolith

Every piece of code included here has a clear learning or demonstration purpose.

## 📌 How to Use This Repository as a Portfolio

Browse by domain (backend, frontend, algorithms)

Review project READMEs for context and decisions

Focus on problem-solving and structure, not only output

Evaluate code quality, organization, and documentation

## 📬 Notes

This repository is continuously evolving as new ideas, challenges, and experiments are added.
